# To-do list

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Every React developer builds a to-do list at some point, and this one is mine. This was built when I was just beginning to learn React, to practice using components.

Has interface for creating to-do items, sorting and filtering them by difficulty, and saving them to local storage.
